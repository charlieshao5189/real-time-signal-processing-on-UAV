## Abstract:
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in both civilian and military fields nowadays. Early applications mainly focus on imaging area due to the diffi-culty in collecting clean audio data. However, there are huge demands for airborne audio applications. In this thesis, the possible solutions for airborne audio applica-tions of UAV are investigated. Here, a number of frequently used filters for audio signal processing such as median filter, FIR filter, adaptive filters are addressed. It also reveals how these filters will help UAV audio applications according to their specific features. The hardware and software implementation of a real-time audio signal pro-cessing system is designed on ZYBO, which is a development boardusing Xilinx Zynq-7000 all programmable ARM/FPGA SoC. This design follows the concept of hardware and software co-design. The results show that ZYBO platform is efficient and robust enough to support UAV airborne real-time audio signal processing.
